    <!-- Describe what the website does -->
    <p> 
        This webpage's purpose is to showcase findings from a weather data exploration.  Weather data was scraped
        from OpenWeatherMaps API. The visuals themeselves were created with Python by scraping weather data based 
        on randomly generated latitudes, storing them in dataframes, and then creating visuals from those 
        dataframes with Matplotlib.  The data used for this project was scraped on 1-5-17.   
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This website has the 4 visuals, each of which show the relationship between four key weather data and Latitude.
        These data include temperature [F], wind speed [mph], cloudiness[%], and humidity[%].  An in-depth analysis for each
        visual can be found on the Plots subpages.  This website also includes the raw data used to create these plots 
        and a comparison page to see all the plots next to eachother.
