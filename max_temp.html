    <p> 
        As cities are closer to the equator (Latitude Deg 0), we can see the general trend 
        that temperatures tend to get hotter.  We can also see that cities in the northern
        hemisphere (Latitudes greater than Deg 0) tend to be colder.  This could be attributed 
        to the fact that on 1-5-17, when the data was collected, it would be winter in the 
        northern hemisphere and summer in the southern hemisphere due to the tilt of the earth.
